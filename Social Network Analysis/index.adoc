Description of the script: This script creates a graph based on a csv file and 
gives us information like general statistics, communities, centralities, and 
different ways to visualize the data.
Input of the function: data in csv format
Output of the function: (centralities.png, communities.png, components.png)<-based on the subgraph, (Graph.gexf and Subgraph.gexf)<-gexf.zip
IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE FUTURE: extract the closeness and betweeness centrality of the graph and plot the eigenvector centrality of the subgraph
